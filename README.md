# 🛠️ Developer Playground 

🚀 **Live Demo**: [View App](https://eusebiedev.github.io/playground/)

A personal interactive learning space made up of small web apps, creative tools, and fun experiments.

This project is all about **knowledge reinforcement**, **core frontend skills**, and **creative exploration**. Each mini-project helps me deepen my understanding of development topics through hands-on building, iteration, and play.

## 🔍 What You'll Find

- 🧠 Interactive dev tools and UI experiments  
- 🎨 HTML, CSS, Tailwind, and JavaScript-based projects  
- ⚛️ Some apps will include React and other modern web tech  
- 🚧 Constantly evolving and in-progress  

## 📚 Why This Exists

This playground exists to help me:

- Practice and reinforce key development concepts  
- Explore new ideas in a low-stakes environment  
- Stay creative while leveling up my skills  
- Share the process openly with others

## 🧩 Projects

- **Console Toolbox** – Learn about more useful commands beyond the rudimentary console.log  
- **...coming soon** 
- **..another placeholder**
